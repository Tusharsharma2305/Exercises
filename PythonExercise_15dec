Question 5. Create a bus child class that inherits from the vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity* 100. If vehicle is bus instance, we need to add 10% extra on full fare as a maintenance charge.
So total fare for the bus instance will be the final amount = total fare+ 10% of the total fare.
Note: the bus seating capacity is 50
         You need to override the fare() method of a vehicle class in bus class


class Vehicle():

  def __init__(self,seats):
    self.fare = seats*100
    self.total_fare = self.fare + (0.10*self.fare)
  def totFare(self):
    print(self.total_fare)

class bus(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self,seats):
    super().__init__(seats)

obj = bus(50)
obj.totFare()
